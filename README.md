# Sleeper-API-Project

## Description

This project was a test of our coding skills, along with a test of our teamwork skills.  We were supposed to design an application, that used our knowledge of server-side APIs, UI design, along with using our knowledge of GitHub to work with our group.  

## Challenges

Even thought our group believes that we created an application that meets high standards, that doesn't mean the we didn't have our fair share of challenges throughout the project.  Our main challenges were, getting GitHub and specifically branches to work, getting the data from the Sleeper API, and making the UI user friends while also being practical.

### GitHub and Branches

Reliably using GitHub, along with branches, as a team was shown to be more difficult than we expected.  Throughout the project we had our fair share of issues when trying to get everything to work for everybody in the group.  Branches kept getting mixed up, and at first we had issues with keeping everybody's work seperate.  However, even though this was an issue for us in the beginning.  By the end of the project timeline we all have a better understanding about how to use Branches along wit GitHub, when interacting with other users.

### Sleeper API

The API process was a constant issue for everybody, mainly because it's a relatively new concept for everyone.  Main issues were operating a new API that nobody in our group has used before.  However, by the end of it, Andy learned a lot about the Sleeper API, and he ended up getting a large majority of everything to show up correctly by the end of our timeline.

### UI

The UI was especially hard to make because of the amount of differences in our data, along with the user's ourput.  Making everything mobile friendly was espeically a pain, but by the end we got everything to work and everybody in our group was satisfied with how everything turned out.

## Conclusion

This project was a great way for us to show off our newly learned skills, along with also allowed us to finally work with a whole group to complete a task, much different than our other challenges.  This was a great opprotunity to see what it was like working with other people, mainly becuase that's what a job in this industry will entail.  All in all, completing this project was a great way for all of us to gain confidence in our work.
